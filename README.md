# Getting started

## Pre-requisites

- Yarn
- Node 10x

This project uses JSDoc syntax to automatically generate docs and usage instructions within
storybook so it's recommended to familiarise yourself with JSDoc syntax



## Developing components

To start the watch server

```sh
yarn storybook
```

When developing components they should be in their own named folder under `./components/NameOfComponent`.
